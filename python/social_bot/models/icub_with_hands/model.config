        Model for the iCub humanoid robot with hands and cameras.

        For more information please check http://www.icub.org and https://github.com/robotology/icub-gazebo
        Some modifications are made to save computational cost:
            Yarp control board plugins for ICub were removed
            Force torque sensors Plugins from libgazebo_yarp_forcetorque.so were removed
            Joints dedicated to install force torque sensors were removed or fixed
            Some links are too heavy that even the force limit is still hard to drive the joints, lower the mass for them (like the 4 kg root link)
